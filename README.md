A fork of the repo here : [Bootstrap-Datepicker](https://github.com/uxsolutions/bootstrap-datepicker)

### CSS Styles

The repo has been updated to Bootstrap 4 stylesheet using the .scss file from the repo [here](https://github.com/Alanaktion/bootstrap4-datepicker)

  <hr>

### JS Styles

The alignment of datepicker element was still off.
Corrected it to suit Bootstrap v4 Margin values.
